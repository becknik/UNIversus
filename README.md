# UNIversus
An **universitary knowledge collection** of a ambitious CS students using the great [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Markdown tool with it's extending syntax and graph-view. This project is aiming to **sum up** all (essential) parts of teached subjects in a cross-(Wiki-)linking approach.
However, keep in mind that the summaries were *initially created for myself*, and therefore are directed to *my personal* way of thinking and understanding.

## Getting Started:
All files are fully *Markdown-compatible*, so you could actually browse this collection with any MD-compatible text-editor. But to get the best out of the Obsidian MD-flavor and the *most fluent experience* I recommend…
- Installing Obsidian from the [Official Webiste](https://obsidian.md/)
	-> There you may read more about what I meant with "most fluent experience"
- Switch between *Editing*- and a more pleasing *Reading-Mode* by clicking the right top corner icon or *Ctrl+e*
- If you should find liking in what you see, I can generally recommend to read my Obsidian [[Recommendations]] or just starting researching yourself
- If you should be interested in contributing or enhancing my notes, consider writing me an [private E-Mail](jannikb@posteo.de) or open a Issue/ Merge Request :^)
	-> [[Style-Guide]]

### Flashcards for Everyone
Currently I use this Vault in combination with the [Anki Flashcards Plugin](https://github.com/reuseman/flashcards-obsidian). Unfortunately this plugin only works for on person at the same time.
Maybe I soon will release my generated [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)-Decks on the [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/)…

## Note, that…
I do not sync the full `.obsidian` folder due to the locality of Obsidian's plugin system and individual customization
	-> Whats contained are:
- `app.json` for general default settings. Yes, I somehow manage to use this buggy implementation of VIM
- `core-plugins.json`
	-> `backlink.json` & `switcher.json` for the minimal intersect of core plugin settings
- `graph.json` for a personally eye-candy customized, extendable view of the graph
