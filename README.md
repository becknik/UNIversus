# UNIversus
An *universitary knowledge collection* of a CS student, using the [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) Markdown tool with it's extending syntax and features.

---

This project is aiming to *sum up* all essential parts of taught subjects of the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/) *CS bachelor degree* course in a Wiki-like cross-linking approach.

This repo also holds some *tips for Obsidian* I started obeying to manage a general summary, which might be interesting for people aiming to create their own summaries/ vaults.

### Disclaimers

Be aware that the summaries were *initially created for myself* and therefore are sensitive to *my personal* way of thinking and understanding. If you finde some of it not optimal, please consider the contact section below.

Note, that only the README, [Recommendations](./Recommendations.md) and [Style-Guide](./Style-Guide.md) file are written in *English* to make the gathered *recommendations* and *best practices* for Obsidian usable for *international readers*.
The summaries however are written in my *native language*, which is German.

## Motivation

I think this way of writing summaries offers many benefits which overcome the drawbacks (which are especially getting used to it & time conumption):
- The best summary structure a human being could wish for, due to it's easy editability, dynamic way of linking topics and of course the resulting *graph structure*
- The best way to create *neat and noiseless* topic-files (lets just call it "$\text{Design}\in\overline{\text{THEO}}$"), which you might just *learn better* with on any of your terminal devices
- No more *lectures PDF scrolling* to find a topics or theorems definition when solving exercice sheets or wirting exam cheat sheets - Just make use of Obsidians search bar
- A long lasting, *wiki-like* knowledge pool, which eventually make some topics faster graspable my providing examples or a more extensive explanation
- The best way I (so far) came across to share *Anki flashcard decks* and keep them *up-to-date* with *additions and corrections* (see "Flashcards for Everyone" section below)
- Maybe: a better learning curve by discovering links between topics of different courses and therefore setting things in relation
- Summary files might be easily shared by exportation to short PDFs
- A lot more things…

## (So far) unsovled Questions:

- [ ] How to provide people with up to date Anki card decks, which are generated from this vault?
> AnkiWeb as best-so-far solution. Somtimes I forgett to commit & push or update cards on AnkiWeb. Automation of publication & pulling would be nice.
> AnkiWeb pulished decks are available 24h after publishing, which is REALLY annoying
- [ ] How to coordinate a gaint summary during the writing phase?

## Getting Started

As already mentioned, all files are formatted in a extended *Markdown-Syntax*, so you could browse this collection with any MD-compatible text-editor.
To get the *most fluent experience* of Obsidian's MD-flavor it's recommend to install Obsidian from the [Official Webiste](https://obsidian.md/) (and maybe watch a Tutorial).

### How to Obsidian
I'd recommend you to watch some tutorials on this point.
What especially comes in handy for this project:
- `Ctrl+e` - For switch between *Editing-* and *Reading-Mode* 
- `Ctrl+g` - For a view on the *graph view* Obsidian creates out of the links between summaries

### How to start your own Obsidian vault
As mentioned above, there exists a rather basic [Recommendations](./Recommendations.md) file and a really extensive [Style-Guide](./Style-Guide.md) file. The last one aims to discuss the "design-decissions" I made and the tips & "best practises" I think to discover in this vault.
If you should find liking in what you see and you might want to *start your own* private Obsidian vault, I would definitifley recommend you to read through them. They explain a way which works best for me.

### How to Anki-Flashcards for everyone
One great element of the subset of Obsidian [community plugins](./Recommendations.md) I daily use is the Anki [Flashcards Plugin](https://github.com/reuseman/flashcards-obsidian). I came over the idea to mirroring my generated [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)-decks for the courses in this repo on the [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/), where you can download the lastest version each.

#### Shared decks:
> When the linked deck is currently not available, this is due to I uploaded a new version (and AnkiWeb being shitty). Come back within `24h`, then it should be definitively available.
