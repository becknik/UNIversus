# UNIversus
An **universitary knowledge collection** of a ambitious CS students using the great [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Markdown tool with it's extending syntax and graph-view. This project is aiming to **sum up** all (essential) parts of teached subjects in a cross-(Wiki-)linking approach.

However, keep in mind that the summaries were *initially created for myself*, and therefore are directed to *my personal* way of thinking and understanding.

Even though *this*, the [[Recommendations]] and the [[Style-Guide]] file are written in *English* to make my gathered *best practices* useful for an *international heading*, the summary is written in my native language, **German**.

## Getting Started:
All files are fully *Markdown-compatible*, so you could actually browse this collection with any MD-compatible text-editor. But to get the best out of the Obsidian MD-flavor and the *most fluent experience* I recommend…
- Installing Obsidian from the [Official Webiste](https://obsidian.md/)

	-> There you may read more about what I meant with "most fluent experience"
- Switch between *Editing*- and a more pleasing *Reading-Mode* by clicking the right top corner icon or *Ctrl+e*. To display the *graph view* select the left sided icon or just hit *Ctrl+g* or
- If you should find liking in what you see and you might want to *start your own* private Obsidian vault, I can recommend to go through my Obsidian [[Recommendations]] or just watch some tutorials

	-> Please **first install the application** and the open the linked file. *GitHub's markdown flavor* seems to not support some important typographic marking…
- If you should be interested in *contributing or enhancing* my notes, consider writing me an [private E-Mail](jannikb@posteo.de) or open a Issue/ Merge Request :^)

	-> [[Style-Guide]]

### Flashcards for Everyone
Currently I use this Vault in combination with the [Anki Flashcards Plugin](https://github.com/reuseman/flashcards-obsidian). Unfortunately this plugin only works for one person at the same time.

Maybe I soon will release my generated [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)-Decks on the [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/)…

## Note, that…
I do not sync the full `.obsidian` folder due to the locality of Obsidian's plugin system and individual customization
	-> Whats contained are:
- `app.json` for general default settings.
> Yes, I somehow manage to make use of this buggy implementation of VIM
- `core-plugins.json`
	-> `backlink.json` & `switcher.json` for the minimal intersect of core plugin settings
- `graph.json` for a personally eye-candy customized, extendable view of the graph
- A settings example for the [Obsidian Linter](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter) plugin, on which you can read more in the community plugin [[Recommendations]] section

> This project's name was inspired by my friend and fellow student [Anton Sproll](https://github.com/fewpews) and this [UNIverum](https://github.com/fewpews/UNIversum) project. Also, I just took notice of Obsidian's existence because of this great guy :^)
